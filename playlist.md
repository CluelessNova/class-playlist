# This is the start of Chris Petrella’s song section
Songs I find relaxing. Most are from video games, but they’re nice anyway.
Decided to try to stick with lyric-less versions
These are all versions of the same song, figured different people would like different versions.
Mewmore // Unwavering Emotions (Pokémon Black & White Remix) 
Mewmore // Emotion (Pokémon Black & White Remix) 
Pokémon X/Y - B/W Emotion theme HD (Official) 
Not sure how relaxing this one is, it might be mostly memory on my part, it comes from one of my favorite games ever.
 PMD2 - DON'T EVER FORGET - Orchestral Remix 
This was one of my first relaxing songs, it loops really well
Evening Star - One Summer's Day 
The above guy has some other great ones too:
Evening Star - Beautiful Night 
Evening Star - City in the Sky 
Apparently I made an older version of this list about two years ago? This was on it:
Xenoblade - Beyond the Sky (Acoustic Guitar Cover) 
Another guitar cover
「Melodies of Life」ファイナルファンタジーIXより／南澤大介 (acoustic guitar solo) 
And more songs
HIKARI (2016 Piano & String Version) - Kingdom Hearts - by Sam Yung 
Sword Art Online - A Tender Feeling Extended 
Another one
Chrono Trigger - Wind Scene (600 A.D.) Orchestral Remix
